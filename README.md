# Dog Image Classification
In this project, we'll walk through an end to end deep learning project to classify dog images using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
We have around 4000 images of dogs, originally extracted from Stanford, but we'll use a simpler dataset for clear understanding of the project for now. 

## Proposed Architecture 
First we'll setup the project, read the dataset in and explore the images. Then we'll trian the convolutional neural network using sequential and dense layers to classify the images by breed, and optimize the model using adam optimizer. After looking at the model error, we'll improve our model's accuracy using data augmentation.
